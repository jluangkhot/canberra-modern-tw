# 11056 - Assessment 2: Front-end theme - Documentation

## Personal contribution:
In this project, I served as the person in charge of the Canberra Modern and Videos parts of the web page. Although I have mainly used traditional HTML and CSS for website production before, this is my first time coming into contact with Tailwind CSS, so it will take more time to learn and understand this new CSS framework. In the project, I took on the following tasks:
1. Use Tailwind CSS to design and layout Canberra Modern and Videos pages.
2. Adjust the style and layout of the page to ensure consistency with the design drawing.
3. Handle layout issues and style adjustment needs that arise on the page.
4. Actively participate in team discussions and meetings, and negotiate with other members to resolve problems.

During the project, I gradually became familiar with the usage of Tailwind CSS through study and practice, and was able to quickly create various styles. At the same time, through communication and cooperation with team members, I have a deeper understanding of web design layout, which also improves my design capabilities and skill levels.

## Problem solved:
During the project development process, I faced some challenges, mainly focusing on the following aspects:
1. Learning and application of Tailwind CSS: Since I have never been exposed to Tailwind CSS before, it takes a certain amount of time to learn its basic usage and implementation methods of common styles. During the project, I encountered some layout and style adjustment problems, but I gradually solved these problems by consulting official documents and online resources, as well as discussing and sharing with team members.
2. Teamwork and communication: Teamwork and communication are the keys to project success. During the project, we communicated through online meetings and face-to-face discussions to jointly solve problems and adjust plans. In team collaboration, we had a big problem merging all the code together. Among them, there was a conflict in part of the code, which caused us to need more time to think about and solve the problem. To resolve this dilemma, we had to spend an extra day discussing and working it out. Fortunately, our team leader was extremely helpful during this process, and her guidance and leadership helped us overcome this challenge and ultimately resolve the issue smoothly, ensuring the smooth progress of the project.

## Teamwork:
In terms of team collaboration, we have established an effective communication mechanism, holding regular online meetings and face-to-face discussions to promptly solve problems and adjust plans that arise during the project. Team leaders play an important leading and guiding role in the team, helping team members clarify their ideas and solve problems. In terms of task allocation, we reasonably allocate tasks according to each person's expertise and interests to ensure the smooth progress of the project.

## References and Resources:
During the project, I found the following resources to be very helpful when creating my website:
1. Tailwind CSS official documentation: Provides a wealth of usage methods and examples of styles and components, helping me quickly learn and master the usage of Tailwind CSS.
2. Online forums and communities: By communicating with Tailwind CSS users and other developers, I got a lot of answers to questions and practical suggestions, which were of great help to the problems I encountered in the project.
3. Discussion and sharing within the team: Communication and sharing with team members is also an important way for me to learn and grow. Through discussion and sharing with them, I not only solved the problems in the project, but also learned a lot of new knowledge and skills. .

#### Summarize:
By participating in this project, I not only learned how to use Tailwind CSS for web design and layout, but also improved my team collaboration and communication skills. In the process of solving problems and completing tasks, I continued to learn and grow, and made my own contribution to the successful completion of the project. I believe this experience will be helpful to my future work and study. I look forward to playing my role in more projects and continuously improving my skills and abilities.
